# BitBurner Code
A few handy bits of code I wrote for BitBurner

# Python Scripts

Both of these scripts contain a lot of commented code that does some neat stuff, along with a bit you'll have to edit.

BitBurnerBreakOpen.py is intended to be run from within the .../Bitburner/resources/app/ folder

BitBurnerSaveEdit.py is intended to be run in the same folder as a bitburner save file.

# Nodescript Files

These only really work once you have the singularity functions and have cracked the game open with BitBurnerBreakOpen.py
But once you do, running them in order should allow you to beat any node in about 5 seconds.
